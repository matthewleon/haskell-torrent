haskell-torrent (10000.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Taking over upstream maintenance of this package.
  * Updated to build with the current haskell ecosystem.
  * Removed SHA1 implementation for simplicity, and removed iInfoHash
    from Torrent.
  * Use the PVP rather than date-based version.
